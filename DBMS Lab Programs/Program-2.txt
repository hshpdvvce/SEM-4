2. Consider the following schema for order database

salesman(salesman_id,name,city,commission)
customer(customer_id,cust_name,city,grade,salesman_id)
orders(ord_no, purchase_amt,ord_date, customer_id,salesman_id)

Write SQL queries to
a) Count the customers with grades above Bangalore's average.
b) Find the name and number of all salesmen who had more than one customer.
c) List all the salesman and indicate those who have and do not have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation)
d) Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.
e) Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted.
